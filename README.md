# 🎤 Smart Interview Preparation Platform  
*A Personalized and Adaptive Platform for Diverse Career Domains*

## 📌 Overview

This project is a full-featured, privacy-first, AI-assisted interview preparation platform designed to help candidates across career domains practice mock interviews, improve communication skills, and receive real-time, actionable feedback.  

Users can select their **target domain, role, and company**, upload resumes, and engage in **voice-based interactive sessions** that evaluate both **technical** and **behavioral** responses.

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Domain-Specific Mock Interviews**  
✅ **Resume-Based Question Generation**  
✅ **Speech Feedback** (Clarity, Filler Words, Pacing)  
✅ **Personalized NLP Analysis** of verbal answers  
✅ **Gamified Progress Tracking**  
✅ **Secure & Offline-Capable Design**  
✅ **Mobile and Desktop Friendly**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```

Frontend (React.js)
|
Backend (FastAPI / Flask)
|
ML & NLP Services (Audio + Text Models)
|
Database (MongoDB)

````

- Microservices architecture (audio analysis, resume parser, feedback engine)
- Modular ML pipeline for clarity scoring, pacing detection, content relevance
- Real-time feedback visualized with Chart.js/D3.js

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User Registration & Resume Upload**  
   - Parses skills, roles, and education using NER (spaCy or custom model)

2. **Mock Interview Generator**  
   - Dynamically adapts questions to user profile

3. **Voice Recording & Analysis**  
   - Audio processed with Librosa, Whisper, or Vosk
   - ML model scores speech clarity, confidence, expressiveness

4. **Textual Feedback via NLP**  
   - Evaluates response quality, relevance, and grammar

5. **Gamified Feedback Dashboard**  
   - Progress visualizations, achievement badges, performance trends

## 📦 Installation

### Backend
```bash
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
````

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a connection string in `.env`.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

* AES-256 encryption for user data
* Voice logs stored locally
* Session data encrypted (JWT)
* No reliance on pretrained cloud APIs (can be used fully offline)

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* LLM integration (optional) for deeper answer feedback
* Mock interviewer voice feedback
* Admin dashboard for trainers/institutes
* Multi-language support

---

## 📚 References

This project builds upon research and architecture from:

* Conversate (ACM, 2025)
* EZInterviewer (WSDM 2023)
* Explainable AI (XAI) in mock interviews
* Whisper & spaCy (OpenAI, ExplosionAI)
